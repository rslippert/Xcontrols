# XControls - Orion like Spacecraft Controls "Glass"
* [Video Explaining How To Use xcontrols](https://youtu.be/yMjt7c)

## About Xcontrols and Gateway 2024
Xcontrols was developed to provide Orion Spacecraft like controls for the Gateway 2024 simulation. The simulation uses 3 degrees of freedom and CR3BP 3 body orbital mechanics while in Cislunar space. With this it can propagate any orbit between the earth and moon and can enter the Gateway NRHO orbit and dock with the Gateway spacecraft. For landing on the moon, the mechanics is switched to Kepler style with 6 degrees of freedom and 13 states including spacecraft and fuel mass.

The Xcontrols GitHub repository will use the YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/Blue2studio), for posting examples and tutorials.
